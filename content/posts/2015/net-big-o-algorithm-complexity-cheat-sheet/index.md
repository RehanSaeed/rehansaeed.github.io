# Credits

All credit goes to the creator of the Big-O Algorithm Complexity Cheat Sheet [Eric Rowell](https://twitter.com/ericdrowell) and the many contributors to it. You can find the original [here](http://bigocheatsheet.com/). I simply added .NET specific bits to it and posted it on GitHub [here](https://github.com/RehanSaeed/.NET-Big-O-Algorithm-Complexity-Cheat-Sheet).

# What is it?

It covers the space and time [Big-O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) notation complexities of common algorithms used in Computer Science and specifically the .NET framework.

# Why is it useful?

You can see which collection type or sorting algorithm to use at a glance to write the most efficient code.

This is also useful for those studying Computer Science in University or for technical interview tests where Big-O notation questions can be fairly common depending on the type of company you are apply to.

# Let me have it!

You can download the cheat sheet in three different formats:
