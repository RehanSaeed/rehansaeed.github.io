# Learning GraphQL

Here is a list of resources I found useful when learning GraphQL:

- [graphql.org](https://graphql.org/learn/) - The official documentation is actually a really good way to learn the GraphQL query language which will get you as far as being able to read and write data from a GraphQL server.
- [howtographql.com](https://www.howtographql.com/basics/0-introduction/) - This site will get you a little further and re-enforce knowledge about the GraphQL query language used on the client side but also talks about GraphQL on the server side using JavaScript.
- [Frontend Masters - Advanced GraphQL](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/advanced-graphql/) - This is a paid course but you can use the free trial. It's by [Scott Moss](https://twitter.com/scotups) and I was very impressed by it's quality. It covers how to build a GraphQL server using JavaScript and NodeJS. I know this is an ASP.NET Core blog post but GraphQL started life as a JavaScript project and if you really want to go in depth, I found it useful to see this and pick up a few tips that can translate to C#.
