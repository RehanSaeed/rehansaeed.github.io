I started live streaming my software development learnings simultaneously on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/MuhammadRehanSaeed) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/rehansaeeduk) a few months ago. I'm by no means a professional and only have a couple hundred subscribers and a few thousand views at this time but I've had a lot of fun learning and sharing my learnings with the world.

After streaming for a while, I discovered that I hadn't been writing much code at work as my role at Microsoft has evolved into one that has meant more project management style work and leading a team of developers. So It's been rather liberating to force myself to allocate an hour to a live stream where I can go and learn something new or update one of my many open source projects with some new feature. I realized that I do indeed really like writing, thinking and talking about code and I want to continue to do more of it going forward.

I put together a few YouTube playlists of the live streams I've done so far.

# .NET 6 and C# 10

This is where it all started, just before the release of .NET 6 and C# 10. There were **a lot** of hidden and not so obvious features in this release that I haven't seen many blog posts or videos cover. I've been gathering these gems for the last year and talk about each one at length in this YouTube playlist.

# Twitter Snowflake ID's

Twitter uses Snowflake ID's to generate unique identifiers for tweets. In this YouTube playlist I deep dive into how Twitter does this and using ASP.NET Core minimal API's to create an API. I think Twitter Snowflake ID's are a really cool way of generating really clean looking globally unique ID's and its worth looking into them as an alternative to ugly GUID's.

# Pulumi, Azure and .NET

[Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) is a tool used to build, deploy, and manage your cloud applications using pretty much any language on any cloud. I used Pulumi with .NET to play around with [Azure Container Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/pricing/details/container-apps/) which I found to be promising but very early in its development. I'm also now looking into creating an [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/kubernetes-service/) cluster using Pulumi.

# Feedback

Since I'm new to this, I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions. Oh and don't forget to **subscribe and smash that like button**! Sorry, its obligatory to say that once you post videos to YouTube. I can't get over how silly it sounds when I say it.
