I did a fun podcast episode with [Leonardo Tuna](https://www.leotuna.com/). We talked about the difficulty of getting a job at Microsoft, some of my work there, JavaScript frontend frameworks, Vue vs React and my interesting experiences writing software for education at Bridge International Academies.

Leonardo is also looking for other developers from all walks of life who are interested in recoding podcast episodes, so if you're interested give him a ping.
