Keeping up with the changes in the software development industry always feels like a losing battle. Just when I feel like I've started to catch up and learn the things I need to know to do my job (and hobby), a new version of something is released or even worse, something totally revolutionary comes out which means we have to start learning from first principles again.

[WebAssembly](https://twitter.com/RehanSaeedUK/status/895705722943660033) is one such technology which is a game changer but still at the prototype stage. When it does hit, prepare for the whirlwind. Prepare to throw away most of what you knew and re-learn that which is now deemed the state of the art and the way to do things.

At some point in history it was possible for a single human being to learn all scientific knowledge known to mankind if they could somehow get hold of the information. We've long since surpassed that point with a single technology like .NET, let alone software development in general.

Then you've got the cross-functional developers out there. The ones that try to learn everything required to build a complete application. I try to do this but I have the constant feeling that I'm behind, that I need to catch up. It's impossible to learn everything in any real depth, so you have to skim the surface of some technologies to get by. I wish I knew more about T-SQL, ElasticSearch, Webpack and pretty much all of the myriad of JavaScript frameworks.

I'm not complaining of course, having to learn is what keeps it interesting and what keeps us coming back for more.

The list below is my personal list of RSS feeds that I follow to keep up to date. I've put this list together over several years and use an RSS feed reader called [Feedly](https://feedly.com) which keeps track of the articles I've read. Hopefully, it helps you keep up to date.

Videos are a great way to learn but they do suck up a lot of time so be selective.

They post way too much content for me to handle. You have to be very selective about what you watch. Talks also get repeated quite a bit in different conferences. I'm still watching videos from the last conference when the next one rolls up.
