This is <em>the</em> list of those to watch for the future of Open Technology. All are earmarked as leading the next generation of Open Technology whether through social media, their jobs, community contributions, policy or in education.</p>\n<p>The British Honours system is something very specific to the UK and a means of rewarding an individual for their achievement or service. Medals are used within this system to recognise an activity or long or valuable service.</p>\n<p>Congratulations to all of those listed. Enjoy the recognition of our New Yearâ€™s Honour from your peers at OpenUK and we look forward to seeing all that you will achieve in Open Technology through 2022 and beyond.</p>\n<footer><cite><a href=\"https://openuk.uk/2022HonoursList/\">Open UK 2022 Honours List</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the second year the award has been handed out.
