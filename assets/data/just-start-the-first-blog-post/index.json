I started creating this website because I wanted to create a space where I could post interesting things I found or learned whilst working as a software developer or just generally in life. I hope to not just blog about software development, best practices or cool code snippets, but also look into some of the other “soft skills” a developer might need, such as software design and aesthetics which I have a particular interest in.</p>\n<p>I've reached a point where I've helped build some pretty cool stuff in my career so far. I now want to share some of these things with the wider community. Hopefully, I'll have written some code which is of use to someone. Feel free to drop a comment now and again…</p>\n","cover_image":"/images/hero/Just-Start-1366x768.png"}},"context":{}}
