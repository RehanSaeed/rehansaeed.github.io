It's by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scotups\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Scott Moss</a> and I was very impressed by it's quality. It covers how to build a GraphQL server using JavaScript and NodeJS. I know this is an ASP.NET Core blog post but GraphQL started life as a JavaScript project and if you really want to go in depth, I found it useful to see this and pick up a few tips that can translate to C#.</li>\n</ul>\n","heroImage":"/images/hero/Microsoft-.NET-1366x768.png"}},"context":{}}
