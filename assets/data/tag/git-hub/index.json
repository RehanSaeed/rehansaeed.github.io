Windows uses a Carriage Return (CR) followed by the Line Feed (LF) character, while Unix based operating systems use the Line Feed (LF) alone. All of this has it's origin in typewriters which is pretty amazing given how antiquated they are. I recommend reading the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Newline Wikipedia article</a> for more on the subject.</p>\n<p>Newline characters often cause problems in Git when you have developers working on different operating systems (Windows, Mac and Linux). If you've ever seen a phantom file change where there are no visible changes, that could be because the line endings in the file have been changed from CRLF to LF or vice versa.</p>\n<p>Git can actually be configured to automatically handle line endings using a setting called <a href=\"https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">autocrlf</a>. This automatically changes the line endings in files depending on the operating system. However, you shouldn't rely on people having correctly configured Git installations. If someone with an incorrect configuration checked in a file, it would not be easily visible in a pull request and you'd end up with a repository with inconsistent line endings.</p>\n<p>The solution to this is to add a <code class=\"language-text\">.gitattributes</code> file at the root of your repository and set the line endings to be automatically normalised like so:</p>\n<div class=\"line-highlight\" data-language=\"git\"><pre class=\"language-git\"><code class=\"language-git\"><span class=\"token comment\"># Set default behaviour to automatically normalize line endings.</span>\n* text=auto\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Force bash scripts to always use lf line endings so that if a repo is accessed</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\"># in Unix via a file share from Windows, the scripts will work.</span>\n*.sh text eol=lf</code></pre></div>\n<p>The second line is not strictly necessary. It hard codes the line endings for bash scripts to be LF, so that they can be executed via a file share. It's a practice I picked up from the <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/.gitattributes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">corefx repository</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"git-large-file-system-lfs\"><a href=\"#git-large-file-system-lfs\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"22\" height=\"22\" aria-hidden=\"aria-hidden\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Git Large File System (LFS)</h3>\n<p>It's pretty common to want to checking binary files into your Git repository. Building a website for example, involves images, fonts, maybe some compressed archives too. The problem with these binary files is that they bloat the repository a fair bit. Every time you check-in a change to a binary file, you've now got both files saved in Git's history. Over time this bloats the repository and makes cloning it slow. A much better solution is to use <a href=\"https://git-lfs.github.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Git Large File System (LFS)</a>. LFS stores binary files in a separate file system. When you clone a repository, you only download the latest copies of the binary files and not every single changed version of them.</p>\n<p>LFS is supported by most source control providers like GitHub, Bitbucket and Azure DevOps. It a plugin to Git that has to be separately installed (It's a checkbox in the Git installer) and it even has it's own CLI command 'git lfs' so you can run queries and operations against the files in LFS. You can control which files fall under LFS's remit in the <code class=\"language-text\">.gitattributes</code> file like so:</p>\n<div class=\"line-highlight\" data-language=\"git\"><pre class=\"language-git\"><code class=\"language-git\"> # Archives\n*.7z filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text\n*.br filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text\n*.gz filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text\n*.tar filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text\n*.zip filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Documents</span>\n*.pdf filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Images</span>\n*.gif filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text\n*.ico filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text\n*.jpg filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text\n*.pdf filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text\n*.png filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text\n*.psd filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text\n*.webp filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Fonts</span>\n*.woff2 filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Other</span>\n*.exe filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text </code></pre></div>\n<p>So here I've added a whole list of file extensions for various file types I want to be controlled by Git LFS. I tell Git that I want to filter, diff and merge using the LFS tool and finally the <code class=\"language-text\">-text</code> argument tells Git that this is not a text file, which is a strange way to tell it that it's a binary file.</p>\n<p>A quick warning about adding LFS to an existing repository with existing binary files checked into it. The existing binary files will be checked into Git and not LFS without rewriting Git history which would be bad and you shouldn't do unless you are the only developer. You will have to add a one off commit to take the latest versions of all binary files and add them to LFS. Everyone who uses the repository will also have to re-clone the repository (I found this out the hard way in a team of 15 people. Many apologies were made over the course of a week). Ideally you add this from day one and educate developers about Git's treatment of binary files, so people don't check-in any binary files not controlled by LFS.</p>\n<h3 id=\"binary-files\"><a href=\"#binary-files\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"22\" height=\"22\" aria-hidden=\"aria-hidden\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Binary Files</h3>\n<p>When talking about the <code class=\"language-text\">.gitattributes</code> file, you will quite often hear some people talk about explicitly listing all binary files instead of relying on Git to auto-detect binary files (yes Git is clever enough to do that) like this:</p>\n<div class=\"line-highlight\" data-language=\"git\"><pre class=\"language-git\"><code class=\"language-git\"><span class=\"token comment\"># Denote all files that are truly binary and should not be modified.</span>\n*.png binary\n*.jpg binary</code></pre></div>\n<p>As you saw above, we already do this with Git LFS but if you don't use LFS, read on as you may need to explicitly list binary files in certain rare circumstances.</p>\n<p>I was interested so I asked a <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57030698/do-i-really-need-to-specify-all-binary-files-in-gitattributes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Stack Overflow question</a> and got great answers.

Sometimes (quite often really but I'm loath to admit it) I get stuck. I'm probably working with some new language, framework or technology and I can't figure out how to do a thing.</p>\n<p>At this point I might try a few things that pop into my head, go to definition on some code to read the comments, even read the documentation if there is any. These are all good strategies to solve a problem. At what point though do you throw your hands up in despair and give up? One hour later? Maybe four? Maybe a couple of days? I've done all three in the past!</p>\n<p>It might be chance, I don't know but usually when I get to this point, it's lunch time or time to go home and spend time with the family. What do you do now? You're stuck and you're going to have to come back to your desk at some point and bang your head against the problem for a second day. Maybe a clear and fresh mind can solve the problem? It's scary and maybe a bit sad how often I think of a solution to a problem I was having while walking home or lying in bed.</p>\n<p>But what if even that does not help? The thought of having to go to work the next day where you will have to try again to solve a seemingly unsolvable problem can be quite depressing sometimes.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-hive-mind-can-help\"><a href=\"#the-hive-mind-can-help\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"22\" height=\"22\" aria-hidden=\"aria-hidden\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Hive Mind can Help</h1>\n<p>The solution is to ask the kind people of the internet for help!

The undisputed number one resource for every developer.</p>\n<p>I have reviewed a lot of CV's in the last two years and there is a growing trend to list your GitHub and Stack Overflow profiles on there. Even if your profile is not listed, I can sometimes find it anyway (the internet is a stalkers dream).</p>\n<p>In all the Stack Overflow profiles I've seen, there is a worrying trend. Very few people actually ask many Stack Overflow questions! The thing is, asking questions is the easiest way to get points and build a very nice Stack Overflow profile too, so it's silly not to do it.</p>\n<p>In my three years <strong>actively</strong> using Stack Overflow (I was a lurker for a while), I've asked 191 questions and answered 143. I'm a bit behind in contributing but even my questions will help people as there will be others who had the same question and got an answer quickly because I had already asked it. In total, this has netted me almost 9,000 imaginary internet reputation, 7 gold badges, 86 silver ones and 152 bronze. Even if I had not answered any questions, and only asked them, I think I would have had a healthy reputation score of a few thousand.</p>\n<p>It's amazing how quickly you can sometimes get answers to your questions using Stack Overflow too, the fastest I've seen is literally 30 seconds! It's such an amazing resource, you literally have people sitting there waiting for you to ask a question so they can get imaginary internet points!</p>\n<p>I get around 5,000 visitors to this blog every week at the moment, it's surprising to me how many people actually contact me directly asking for help. The emails are always the same, \"I read your blog post and I'm working on project X, I need help urgently because I have some deadline\". No supporting code, just a vague hint of what the problem might be, as if I can divine the solution through some kind of telekinesis. I help these people where I can but I've started to feel I'm hindering them by doing so, they need to learn to use Stack Overflow just like everybody else, so that's where I've started pointing them lately.</p>\n<h2 id=\"github-and-forums\"><a href=\"#github-and-forums\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"22\" height=\"22\" aria-hidden=\"aria-hidden\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>GitHub and Forums</h2>\n<p>If you're dealing with a project that uses GitHub or a forum of some kind, use it! Find an existing GitHub issue or forum post and add a comment to it or open a new issue if one cannot be found. One or more developers will get a notification of your problem and they might even point you in the right direction. Once again, it's amazing how quickly you can get a reply sometimes.</p>\n<p>Once again, I've seen a lot of GitHub profiles and very few people use the issues section to ask questions. You often have the developers who literally wrote the code that you're using, answer your question. What can be better than that?</p>\n<h1 id=\"conclusions\"><a href=\"#conclusions\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"22\" height=\"22\" aria-hidden=\"aria-hidden\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusions</h1>\n<p>This post sounds silly but developers don't generally ask for help for some reason. I used to work with a great junior developer who started only with a little VB script knowledge and would ask for help whenever he needed it, which was a dozen or more times a day sometimes. It was hard sometimes to get work done but it was great because after a while he started to get really good and now we had two minds to get work done and come up with ideas instead of one. Ask for help when you need it!</p>\n"}},{"node":{"title":"Social TagHelpers for ASP.NET Core","path":"/social-taghelpers-for-asp-net-core/","date":"19 March 2016","timeToRead":5,"description":"Enhance the experience of sharing a page from your site through the use of social media meta tags implemented with ASP.NET Core TagHelpers.","content":"<p>Social media websites like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pintrest etc. provide ways to enhance the experience of sharing a page from your site through the use of meta tags.

These are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Article</li>\n<li>Books Author</li>\n<li>Books Book</li>\n<li>Books Genre</li>\n<li>Business</li>\n<li>Fitness Course</li>\n<li>Game Achievement</li>\n<li>Music Album</li>\n<li>Music Playlist</li>\n<li>Music Radio Station</li>\n<li>Music Song</li>\n<li>Place</li>\n<li>Product</li>\n<li>Product Group</li>\n<li>Product Item</li>\n<li>Profile</li>\n<li>Restaurant Menu</li>\n<li>Restaurant Menu Item</li>\n<li>Restaurant Menu Section</li>\n<li>Restaurant</li>\n<li>Video Episode</li>\n<li>Video Movie</li>\n<li>Video Other</li>\n<li>Video TV Show</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see there is a lot more choice and detail here. What's confusing is that there is overlap between the Open Graph and Facebook meta tags. Both have sets covering music, video and books, with the Facebook sets requiring you to add far more detailed metadata. The Open Graph tags may play nicer with other social media sites that use these tags while the Facebook ones will obviously give the best experience for the user on Facebook. The above meta tags can be set using my tag helpers or HTML helpers depending on the version of ASP.NET you are using like so:</p>\n<div class=\"line-highlight\" data-language=\"html\"><pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;open-graph-website site-name=\"My Website\"\n                    title=\"Page Title\"\n                    main-image=\"@(new OpenGraphImage(\n                        Url.AbsoluteContent(\"~/img/1200x630.png\"),\n                        ContentType.Png,\n                        1200,\n                        630))\"\n                    determiner=\"OpenGraphDeterminer.Blank\"></code></pre></div>\n<div class=\"line-highlight\" data-language=\"cs\"><pre class=\"language-cs\"><code class=\"language-cs\">@Html<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">OpenGraph</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">OpenGraphWebsite</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>\n    <span class=\"token string\">\"Page Title\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">OpenGraphImage</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>\n        Url<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">AbsoluteContent</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"~/1200x630.png\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n            Height <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">630</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> \n            Type <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> ContentType<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>Png<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> \n            Width <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1200</span> \n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        Determiner <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> OpenGraphDeterminer<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>Blank<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        SiteName <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"My Site\"</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Of course there are tag helpers and HTML helpers for all of the above meta tag sets.</p>\n<h1 id=\"twitter-cards\"><a href=\"#twitter-cards\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"22\" height=\"22\" aria-hidden=\"aria-hidden\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Twitter Cards</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/cards/getting-started\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Twitter cards</a> require meta tags representing one of several 'cards' which can represent different things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>App - A phone app.</li>\n<li>Gallery - A photo gallery.</li>\n<li>Photo - A single photo.</li>\n<li>Player - A video.</li>\n<li>Product - A product you want to sell.</li>\n<li>Summary - A summary of the current page. This is usually the default choice for any page.</li>\n<li>Summary Large Image - The same as summary but with a large image.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have already added Open Graph meta tags, then Twitter can make use of them and you can omit some of the meta tags that Twitter requires. This makes adding a Twitter Card very easy and in fact, most of the time all you need to do is include a Twitter username and the card type. Here is an example of what Twitter card meta tags look like given that you already have Open Graph meta tags:</p>\n<div class=\"line-highlight\" data-language=\"html\"><pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>meta</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">name</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>twitter:card<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">content</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>summary_large_image<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>meta</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">name</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>twitter:site<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">content</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>@RehanSaeedUK<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Below, is an example of how to generate the above code using my tag helpers or HTML helpers. I have used the <code class=\"language-text\">Summary Large Image</code> card (Notice the double <code class=\"language-text\">@</code> sign in the tag helper, this is because <code class=\"language-text\">@</code> is a special character in Razor and a double <code class=\"language-text\">@@</code> escapes the character):</p>\n<div class=\"line-highlight\" data-language=\"html\"><pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>twitter-card-summary-large-image</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">username</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>@@RehanSaeedUK<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre></div>\n<div class=\"line-highlight\" data-language=\"cs\"><pre class=\"language-cs\"><code class=\"language-cs\">@Html<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">TwitterCard</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">SummaryLargeImageTwitterCard</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"@RehanSaeedUK\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>There are also tag helpers and HTML helpers for all of the above Twitter cards.

However, for some strange reason all of them used reflection behind the scenes. At this point I'd like to go on a short rant against using reflection. I've seen a lot of 'clever' code use reflection over the years and I've seen a far too many developers hammer far too many nails using it. It's a very powerful tool but gets abused far too often. Now, back to resuming normal service. This made these libraries pretty slow for generating a few meta tags, not to mention that they don't support ASP.NET Core. My implementation uses a single <code class=\"language-text\">StringBuilder</code> and should be fairly fast.

The best tool I found was <a href=\"https://github.com/gsscoder/commandline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Command Line Parser</a> available on GitHub. It's a pretty powerful and fully features library that makes writing a command line interface very easy. Unfortunately, its output is pretty ugly and it does not let you customize the 'look and feel' of what is output to the console.</p>\n<p>At some point, I'd like to make another contribution to Colorful.Console, so that it offers command line parsing too but take inspiration from several command line parsing libraries to make something that's fully customizable and of course very colourful.</p>\n<p>Command line tools have been around for decades, it's a wonder that a NuGet package that does all of these things does not exist yet.</p>\n"}},{"node":{"title":"Logging with Serilog.Exceptions","path":"/logging-with-serilog-exceptions/","date":"31 January 2016","timeToRead":4,"description":"Log exception details and custom properties that are not output in Exception.ToString() using Serilog.Exceptions for .NET.","content":"<p>Picking a logging framework for your new .NET project?

text? Well, if you store all your logs in something like <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/webinars/get-started-with-elasticsearch?elektra=home&#x26;storm=banner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Elastic Search</a>, you can query your logs and ask it questions. So if we take the above example further we could find all log messages from a particular machine or user with an elapsed time of more than 10 milliseconds and a distance of 10 Km away from the specific location.</p>\n<p>Not only that but if you set up something like <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Kibana</a>, then you can create visualisations for your logs which could grow to be gigabytes in size over time. You can create dashboards with cool charts and maps that look something like this:</p>\n<p><img class=\"g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loading\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0

vital information. Take the <code class=\"language-text\">DbEntityValidationException</code> from EntityFramework as an example. This exception contains vital information buried not in the message but in a custom property called <code class=\"language-text\">EntityValidationErrors</code>. The problem is that when you do an <code class=\"language-text\">exception.ToString()</code> call, this vital information is not included in the resulting string. Even worse, it's not included in the debugger either. This is a pretty major failing in the .NET framework but alas we have to work around it.</p>\n<p>There are literally dozens of questions on <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15820505/dbentityvalidationexception-how-can-i-easily-tell-what-caused-the-error\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Stack Overflow</a> asking how to deal with this problem and all the major logging frameworks fail in this regard. All of them call <code class=\"language-text\">exception.ToString()</code> and fail to log the <code class=\"language-text\">EntityValidationErrors</code> collection.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">DbEntityValidationException</code> is not the only culprit, half the exceptions in the .NET framework contain custom properties that are not logged. The <code class=\"language-text\">Exception</code> base class itself has a <code class=\"language-text\">Data</code> dictionary collection which is never logged either.</p>\n<h1 id=\"serilogexceptions\"><a href=\"#serilogexceptions\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"22\" height=\"22\" aria-hidden=\"aria-hidden\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Serilog.Exceptions</h1>\n<p>I wrote <a href=\"https://github.com/RehanSaeed/Serilog.Exceptions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Serilog.Exceptions</a> to solve this problem.

In particular I am targeting Beta 6 which is the current stable version. I will be regularly updating the template with each new beta until ASP.NET Core is released sometime in November according to Microsoft.</p>\n<p>There are not too many new improved features over the ASP.NET 4.6 MVC 5 version but here is a quick description:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Performance improvements derived from using ASP.NET Core. ASP.NET Core is much improved and no longer uses <code class=\"language-text\">System.Web</code>, so it uses a lot less memory.</li>\n<li>Using <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">NPM</a> and <a href=\"http://bower.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Bower</a> to get CSS and JavaScript scripts rather than NuGet. This means you have a lot more choice and get the latest versions straight from the source.</li>\n<li>Switched from <a href=\"http://lesscss.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">LESS</a> to <a href=\"http://sass-lang.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">SASS</a> for CSS. This decision was made because SASS seems to be more popular and the upcoming Bootstrap 4 has also made the same decision.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://gulpjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Gulp</a> is used instead of the standard ASP.NET 4.6 bundling and minification feature. Not only that but Gulp is also configured to optimize images, rebuild CSS and JavaScript on file change, lint the CSS and JavaScript for common errors and warnings and measure the speed of your site using Google Page Speed.</li>\n<li>The default ASP.NET Core project template uses <a href=\"https://github.com/ixisio/bootstrap-touch-carousel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Bootstrap-Touch-Carousel</a> and <a href=\"https://hammerjs.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Hammer.js</a> for a nice touch friendly carousel control on the home screen.</li>\n<li>There is now a single controller action responsible for displaying errors. This is a lot simpler and a great improvement over MVC 5.</li>\n<li>The logging and caching services are now built into ASP.NET Core, so we use them instead.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"whats-missing\"><a href=\"#whats-missing\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"22\" height=\"22\" aria-hidden=\"aria-hidden\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What's Missing</h1>\n<p>ASP.NET Core is still in beta and there are a lot of third party libraries that don't yet support it.

The .NET Core runtime is still being targeted but the Atom feed will not work and is excluded using <code class=\"language-text\">#if</code> pre-processor directives. I have raised this issue on the .NET teams GitHub page <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/wcf/issues/76#issuecomment-133461504\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. Please do go ahead and show your support for the feature.</p>\n<p>There are other issues around ASP.NET Core missing features from MVC 5 including no support for <code class=\"language-text\">HttpException</code> which I will be looking into adding soon. I am also looking into submitting any improvements I make to the ASP.NET Core GitHub project, so far, I've had one pull request accepted and a few suggestions acted on.</p>\n<h1 id=\"conclusions\"><a href=\"#conclusions\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"22\" height=\"22\" aria-hidden=\"aria-hidden\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusions</h1>\n<p>ASP.NET Core is still in beta but hopefully this project will give an understanding of what can be done with it.

This forces an unsecured HTTP request to be re-sent over HTTPS. It does so without requiring any extra HTTP headers. Instead, this is a function of the MVC framework itself, which checks requests and simply redirects users if they send a normal HTTP request to a HTTPS URL. This attribute can be set globally (Using HTTPS throughout your site is a good idea these days) as shown below:</p>\n<div class=\"line-highlight\" data-language=\"cs\"><pre class=\"language-cs\"><code class=\"language-cs\">filters<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">Add</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">RequireHttpsAttribute</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Both of these lines of code have an overlapping purpose but work in different ways. The <code class=\"language-text\">RequireHttpsAttribute</code> uses the MVC framework, while the NWebSec option relies on browsers responding to the Strict-Transport-Security HTTP header.

Largely because it's super easy to leave your site insecure and open to attack. The default ASP.NET MVC project template is pretty weak when it comes to security. It trades security for simplicity. The <a href=\"https://github.com/Dotnet-Boxed/Templates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ASP.NET Core Boilerplate</a> project template, shifts that balance more in favour of security while still trying to be as simple as possible.

First is the most obvious, you could leave the trace.axd page open to anyone who knows to try that URL on your site. Thus, leaking valuable inside information about your site, as well as the version of ASP.NET and .NET you are using. The fix for this is simple, you just need to remember to remove the tracing node from your <code class=\"language-text\">web.config</code> file.</p>\n<p>Once again, you can use <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=301874\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">configuration file transforms</a> to fix this problem. In your <code class=\"language-text\">Web.Release.config</code> file, you can add the following code to remove tracing but only when the site is built in release mode:</p>\n<div class=\"line-highlight\" data-language=\"xml\"><pre class=\"language-xml\"><code class=\"language-xml\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>system.web</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- customErrors - Turn on custom error pages instead of ASP.NET errors containing stack traces which are a security risk. --></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>customErrors</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\"><span class=\"token namespace\">xdt:</span>Transform</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>SetAttributes(mode)<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">mode</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>On<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- compilation - Turn off debug compilation. --></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>compilation</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\"><span class=\"token namespace\">xdt:</span>Transform</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>RemoveAttributes(debug)<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- trace - Turn off tracing, just in case it is turned on for debugging. --></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>trace</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\"><span class=\"token namespace\">xdt:</span>Transform</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>Remove<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>system.web</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The second problem is that even if you do this, accessing <code class=\"language-text\">http://YourSite/trace.axd</code> causes a 500 Internal Server Error on your site! This gives an attacker a clue that you are using ASP.NET. The correct thing to do is for the site to respond with a 404 Not Found error page instead. It turns out that in release mode you have to remove the tracing <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb398986%28v=vs.140%29.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">HTTP handlers</a> altogether to stop your site responding to this URL. You can do that by adding the following snippet to the <code class=\"language-text\">Web.Release.config</code> file:</p>\n<div class=\"line-highlight\" data-language=\"xml\"><pre class=\"language-xml\"><code class=\"language-xml\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>system.webServer</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- remove TraceHandler-Integrated - Remove the tracing handlers so that navigating to /trace.axd gives us a \n       404 Not Found instead of 500 Internal Server Error. --></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>handlers</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n    <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>remove</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\"><span class=\"token namespace\">xdt:</span>Transform</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>Insert<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">name</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>TraceHandler-Integrated<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span>\n    <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>remove</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\"><span class=\"token namespace\">xdt:</span>Transform</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>Insert<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">name</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>TraceHandler-Integrated-4.0<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>handlers</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>system.webServer</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre></div>\n<h1 id=\"update-40314-forbidden-responses-to-directories\"><a href=\"#update-40314-forbidden-responses-to-directories\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"22\" height=\"22\" aria-hidden=\"aria-hidden\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>(UPDATE) 403.14 Forbidden Responses to Directories</h1>\n<p>Navigating to a directory using IIS and ASP.NET MVC can cause a 403 Forbidden response to be returned. Actually, its a 403.<strong>14</strong> Forbidden response to be exact.

Well, a user would expect a 404 Not Found response if a resource is not found. A 403.14 Forbidden response tells a potential attacker that there is a folder there and that you are using IIS. Not the most useful information to an attacker but combine it with other information and it could be useful. The way to fix this is to handle 403.14 errors and replace the response with a standard 404 Not Found. We just need to add the code below:</p>\n<div class=\"line-highlight\" data-language=\"xml\"><pre class=\"language-xml\"><code class=\"language-xml\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>system.webServer</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- Custom error pages --></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>httpErrors</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">errorMode</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>Custom<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">existingResponse</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>Replace<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- Redirect IIS 403.14 Forbidden responses to the error controllers not found action.\n         A 403.14 happens when navigating to an empty folder like /Content and directory browsing is turned off\n         See http://www.troyhunt.com/2014/09/solving-tyranny-of-http-403-responses.html --></span>\n    <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>error</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">statusCode</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>403<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">subStatusCode</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>14<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">responseMode</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>ExecuteURL<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">path</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>/error/notfound<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- ...Ommitted Code... --></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>httpErrors</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>system.webServer</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Just adding this is not enough however. If I fire up <a href=\"http://www.telerik.com/fiddler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Fiddler</a> Navigating to the <code class=\"language-text\">/Content</code> folder of the site now results in a 301 Document Moved response, followed by a 404 Not Found.

This should not be a problem as we are using ASP.NET MVC controllers and actions and not physical files.</p>\n<div class=\"line-highlight\" data-language=\"xml\"><pre class=\"language-xml\"><code class=\"language-xml\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>system.webServer</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- Stop IIS from doing courtesy redirects used to redirect a link to a directory without\n       to a slash to one with a slash e.g. /Content redirects to /Content/. This gives a clue\n       to hackers as to the location of directories. --></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>defaultDocument</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">enabled</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>false<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>system.webServer</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Now, navigating to <code class=\"language-text\">/Content</code> will return us a simple and correct 404 Not Found and we don't have the courtesy redirect any-more too.

It's insecure, slow, and really has a very basic feature list (That's the point of it). <a href=\"https://github.com/Dotnet-Boxed/Templates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ASP.NET Core Boilerplate</a> provides you with a few more pieces of the puzzle to get you started quicker. It makes liberal use of comments and even gives you a check-list of tasks which you need to perform to make it even better.</p>\n<p>The rest of this article is going to briefly go through the improvements made over using the default MVC template. I'll then finish up with instructions on how you can use it. Also, look out for more posts in the future, where I will go through each feature in detail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"secure-by-default\"><a href=\"#secure-by-default\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"22\" height=\"22\" aria-hidden=\"aria-hidden\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Secure By Default</h2>\n<p>The default MVC template is not as secure as it could be. There are various settings (Mostly in the <code class=\"language-text\">web.config</code> file) which are insecure by default. For example, it leaks information about which version of IIS you are using and allows external scripts to access cookies by default!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Dotnet-Boxed/Templates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ASP.NET Core Boilerplate</a> makes everything secure by default but goes further and uses various HTTP headers which are sent to the browser to restrict things further.</p>\n<p>It also makes use of the new <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/CSP/Introducing_Content_Security_Policy%20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Content Security Policy (CSP)</a> HTTP Header using the <a href=\"https://nwebsec.codeplex.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">NWebSec</a> NuGet packages.

Probably because they don't make any assumptions about which web server you are using. Most of the world and dog that are writing ASP.NET MVC sites use IIS and there are settings in the <code class=\"language-text\">web.config</code> file under the system.webServer section which can make a big difference when it comes to performance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Dotnet-Boxed/Templates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ASP.NET Core Boilerplate</a> makes no such assumptions. It turns on GZip compression for static and dynamic files being sent to the browsers making them smaller and quicker to download. It also uses Content Delivery Networks (CDN) by default to make common scripts like jQuery quicker to download (You can turn this off of course but the point is <a href=\"https://github.com/Dotnet-Boxed/Templates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ASP.NET Core Boilerplate</a> is fast by default).</p>\n<p>That's not all! There are a bunch of other tweaks and examples of practices which can help improve the performance of the site. <a href=\"https://github.com/Dotnet-Boxed/Templates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ASP.NET Core Boilerplate</a> achieves a score of 96/100 on <a href=\"http://yslow.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">YSlow</a> (Its not possible to get the full 100 as some of it's criteria contradict each other and site scripts need to be moved to a CDN).</p>\n<h2 id=\"search-engine-optimization-seo\"><a href=\"#search-engine-optimization-seo\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"22\" height=\"22\" aria-hidden=\"aria-hidden\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h2>\n<p>The default ASP.NET MVC template takes no consideration of Search Engine Optimization at all. ASP.NET Core Boilerplate adds a dynamically generated <code class=\"language-text\">robots.txt</code> file to tell search engines which pages they can index.

This is of course an open source project, I fully expect contributions and suggestions from the community.</p>\n"}}]}}},"context":{}}
