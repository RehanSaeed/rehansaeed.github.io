You have to use <code class=\"language-text\">makecert.exe</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">pvk2pfx.exe</code>, passing in some pretty cryptic arguments which you always have to go back and research.</p>\n<p>Learning how to make a certificate and the different types of certificate is pretty important. I highly recommend reading <a href=\"http://www.jayway.com/2014/09/03/creating-self-signed-certificates-with-makecert-exe-for-development/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this</a> blog post from Jayway.com which has some very detailed instructions and is the basis of MakeCertificate.</p>\n<p>To make things easier I made a PowerShell script called <code class=\"language-text\">MakeCertificate.ps1</code> which you can get on the <a href=\"https://github.com/RehanSaeed/MakeCertificate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">MakeCertificate</a> GitHub page. It asks you to pick the type of certificate you want to create, there are a few different types of certificates that MakeCertificate helps to make: Certificate Authority (CA) Certificates, SSL/TLS Server Certificates and Client Certificates. You are then asked a series of questions which when answered outputs three files</p>\n<ul>\n<li>.cer - A public key file that can be shared.</li>\n<li>.pvk - A private key file that should be kept secret.</li>\n<li>.pfx - A combined public and private key file that should be kept secret.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It also outputs the command you need to execute using <code class=\"language-text\">makecert.exe</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">pvk2pfx.exe</code> to recreate the certificate.</p>\n"}}]}}},"context":{}}
