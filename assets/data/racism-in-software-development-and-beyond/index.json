The study was carried out by the Centre for Social Investigation at Nuffield College, University of Oxford.

What I found particularly interesting was that the high skill jobs they looked at included <strong>software engineers</strong>. They found that there was no difference between applying for high or low skill jobs, you were going to be equally discriminated against.</p>\n<p><img class=\"g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loading\"

Ethnicity Pay Gap Reporting</h2>\n<p>In the UK, if your company has more than 250 employees, you <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gender-pay-gap-reporting-overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">must report the gender pay gap</a> between your male and female employees. This has highlighted the disparity with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/04/gender-pay-gap-figures-show-eight-in-10-uk-firms-pay-men-more-than-women\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">eight out of ten employers</a> paying men more than women.</p>\n<p>Employers should be required to do the same for ethnicity. There is reportedly, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/dec/27/uk-black-and-ethnic-minorities-lose-32bn-a-year-in-pay-gap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">£3.2bn pound gap</a> in wages between ethnic minorities and their white colleagues doing the same jobs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.writetothem.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Email your local member of parliament</a> and urge them to support the requirement for large firms to publish an ethnicity pay gap and perhaps anonymous job applications too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-stop-putting-racists-in-power\"><a href=\"#3-stop-putting-racists-in-power\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"22\" height=\"22\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>3. Stop Putting Racists in Power</h2>\n<p>My prime minister, Boris Johnson, once called black people <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3571742/If-Blairs-so-good-at-running-the-Congo-let-him-stay-there.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">\"piccaninnies\" with \"watermelon smiles\"</a>. When writing about the continent of Africa he said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The problem is not that we were once in charge, but that we are not in charge anymore.</p>\n<footer><cite><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/boris-johnson-foriegn-secretary-us-press-questions-no-laughing-matter-hold-to-account-a7147766.html\">Boris Johnson</a></cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He's been anti-semitic too, writing an <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-book-jews-control-media-general-election-a9239346.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">entire book</a> about powerful Jews controlling the media and influencing elections.</p>\n<p>He's made Islamophobic remarks about Muslim women looking like bank robbers and letterboxes that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/02/boris-johnsons-burqa-comments-led-to-surge-in-anti-muslim-attacks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">caused an up-tick in violence</a> towards Muslim women with racists sometimes using Mr Johnson's exact words. This was apparently in an effort to help them he says. I hope he doesn't try helping anyone else.</p>\n<p>That's not even the half of it, he's also insulted or abused half a dozen other groups of people. It's been fun to watch right wing politicians and political commentators contort themselves into strange shapes trying to defend his blatant racism.</p>\n<p>The sad thing is, if you put a racist in power, many others follow them in their wake. The Conservative party is now <a href=\"https://twitter.com/miqdaad/status/1101781296639025152\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">riddled with racist members, councillors and even members of parliament</a>. The far right group Britain First has even said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/28/britain-first-far-right-members-5000-have-joined-tories\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">5,000 of their members have even joined the Conservative party</a>.</p>\n<p>The solution for me is clear. If you put a racist in charge, they build a whole pyramid of racists underneath them.</p>\n<h1 id=\"conclusions\"><a href=\"#conclusions\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"22\" height=\"22\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusions</h1>\n<p>As many others have said, it's not enough to be a passive non-racist in society. Over the last half a century, structural and institutional racism still pervades our society. It is necessary for us all to be actively working against racism. We also need to recognise that a lot of the inequalities we see come from implicit biases that <strong>all</strong> human beings have, including our own selves. If we recognise that we ourselves are deficient, perhaps we can do something about it.</p>\n","heroImage":"/images/hero/Black-Glowing-Fist-1600x900.png"}},"context":{}}
