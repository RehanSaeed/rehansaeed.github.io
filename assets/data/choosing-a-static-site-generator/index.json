Thinking of writing a post in WordPress just put me off it altogether.</p>\n<p>WordPress stores its posts in HTML. You can use markdown using the new Gutenberg plugin but if you want to edit the post after the fact, you're back to HTML.</p>\n<p>The other issue is that WordPress gets hacked all the time because people don't keep it and any installed plugins up to date. However, I found over the years that when I upgraded a plugin, there was a 50% chance that something was going to break and another 20% chance that I wouldn't find out about it until a week later.</p>\n<p>Plugins were the bane of my life. My code formatting plugin became unsupported without an easy alternative that I could migrate to. This meant I had to stick to an older version of PHP and wait for another plugin to add a migration path.</p>\n<p>Finally, I was paying for hosting on Azure Web apps which isn't the simplest or cheapest option I could have gone with. It was time to move...</p>\n<h1 id=\"static-vs-dynamic-sites\"><a href=\"#static-vs-dynamic-sites\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"22\" height=\"22\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Static vs Dynamic Sites</h1>\n<p>So why switch from a dynamic site like WordPress, to a statically generated site? I found so many reasons, some of which I hadn't thought of before I made the switch.</p>\n<p>The obvious ones are that a static site is going to be faster and cheaper to run. A nice side effect of being faster is that search engines will also give you a little more link juice and rank you higher.</p>\n<p>The biggest win for me was that I can now finally own my own content. It's strange to say that hosting my own WordPress site was not owning my own content but the fact is, I was not fully in control of the content that WordPress was generating. I became painfully aware of this after I had exported my posts from WordPress to markdown.</p>\n<p>I had used certain plugins that formatted content strangely or I was using short codes which don't translate well. There were a myriad of issues. The amazing thing was that I could use VS Code to easily find and replace broken formatting with the help of some regular expression magic (I know enough to be dangerous!). The downside was that I had to manually go back, fix and check every blog post I'd ever written.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, my content is now simple markdown files formatted to my liking. There is nothing simpler than a text file and I am finally in control. If I ever need to pick up and switch to a different static file generator, I can pick-up my content which is in an open, easy to move format and move it easily. I'm never going back.</p>\n<p>The other thing that I really loved was building the site itself. I have a folder of bookmarks containing cool little things you can do on the web that I have collected over the years. I put nearly all of it into practice, which was a lot of fun but did take me a couple of months to finish. It turns out, I love HTML, CSS and JavaScript but particularly CSS where visual feedback is instant and very satisfying.</p>\n<h1 id=\"picking-a-static-site-generator\"><a href=\"#picking-a-static-site-generator\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"22\" height=\"22\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Picking a Static Site Generator</h1>\n<p>Surveying the static site generator landscape was a dizzying experience.

Personally, I think writing simple CSS or SCSS is where it's at.</p>\n<p>In the end though, I found that VuePress is not really geared towards building blogs, it's more geared towards documentation sites for open source projects.

This came too late for me to try but I'd certainly take a deeper look the next time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gridsome\"><a href=\"#gridsome\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"22\" height=\"22\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Gridsome</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://gridsome.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Gridsome</a> is the <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Vue.js</a> equivalent of Gatsby, in that it also uses the power of <a href=\"https://graphql.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">GraphQL</a>.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of plugins that can connect your static site to various sources of data using GraphQL. Want a data driven site? Want to consume some markdown, JSON, random images, content from WordPress or Ghost? Just install a plugin and write a simple GraphQL query.</p>\n<p>In the end, I chose Gridsome for its simplicity. Its just HTML, SCSS and JavaScript at the end of the day (albeit in a single file component). It's the closest solution to the web and also why I really enjoy Vue.js.</p>\n<h1 id=\"hosting-your-static-site\"><a href=\"#hosting-your-static-site\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"22\" height=\"22\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Hosting Your Static Site</h1>\n<h2 id=\"netlify\"><a href=\"#netlify\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"22\" height=\"22\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Netlify</h2>\n<p>I realized that a <strong>lot</strong> of people are using Netlify in my reading. It has a lot of nice little extra features but I personally didn't need any of them but they're worth a look. Netlify has a free tier but does ramp up to being quite costly after that, so beware and make sure your site doesn't use a lot of bandwidth.</p>\n<h2 id=\"github-pages\"><a href=\"#github-pages\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" version=\"1.1\" width=\"22\" height=\"22\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>GitHub Pages</h2>\n<p>I chose to host my site on GitHub pages. It's free until GitHub thinks you're abusing it and asks you to move. It doesn't have any bells or whistles but it works.

Whatever makes you happy! The key is that writing blog posts needs to be low friction, so that you actually end up doing it.</p>\n<p>In my next post, I'll talk about the features I look to build in a blog and which of them I think are essential to a good blog site.</p>\n","heroImage":"/images/hero/Static-Site-Generators-1600x900.png"}},"context":{}}
