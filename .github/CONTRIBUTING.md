# Contributing

All contributions, however small, are valued!

## Pull requests

Open a pull request directly; you do not need to raise an issue or get approval
before contributing. Keep changes focused and explain what changed and why.
Link an existing issue if it provides useful context, but an issue is not required.

## Coding guidelines

- Follow [`.editorconfig`](../.editorconfig) and the existing code conventions.
- Use ESLint for linting and Prettier for formatting.
- Add tests for behavior changes and make sure checks pass.

## CI checks

The Generate job generates and verifies the static site once, then shares that
artifact with parallel Chrome, Edge and Firefox Playwright jobs. Each browser
tests the same `dist` output and build-time image metadata; no browser job
rebuilds the site. Firefox dependencies are installed only in its own job.
Deployment waits for both Generate and all three browser jobs to pass. The Build
check aggregates these results, preserving the existing branch-protection gate
and failing when generation or any browser fails.

## Dependency updates

Commit `package.json` and its regenerated `package-lock.json` together. Run
`npm ci`, `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and the relevant
Playwright tests before merging an update.

Renovate uses full installs (`skipInstalls: false`) to update the lockfile.
npm's lockfile-only path tries to inspect bundled dependencies, including
`@mdream/rust-wasm32-wasi`, by fetching their resolved tarball URLs. With npm 12's
remote-fetch policy this fails with `EALLOWREMOTE`, even for registry packages.
Full installs avoid that path without enabling arbitrary remote dependencies.
Renovate's default lifecycle-script restrictions remain enabled.

Keep TypeScript on version 6 while `vue-tsc` requires its JavaScript compiler
API. A direct TypeScript 7 upgrade fails resolving `typescript/lib/tsc`; a
regenerated lockfile does not fix this. Remove the version restrictions from
`renovate.json` and `.github/dependabot.yml` only after Vue/Nuxt checking supports
the native compiler and the project's type checking passes. See Microsoft's
[embedded-language compatibility guidance](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-7-0/#typescript-and-embedded-languages).
